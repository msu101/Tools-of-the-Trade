Wahoovian Matrix Transformation Program

    This was created for CS 1501 Tools of the Trade Course at UVA.  

The wahoovian function takes a square matrix as its input, and returns a square matrix with the same dimensions.
The output matrix will be the transpose of the input matrix, but with every value in the matrix negated.
If the input matrix is not square or if it has 0 rows and columns, the function will return the input matrix unchanged.
